###TASKS:
* ~~icons change with whoever's turn it is~~
* ~~turns change over~~
* ~~Buttons Have ID's (they know who they are)~~
* ~~After placing a move the icon disables (and keeps its color). yayay~~
* ~~Functional Reset button~~
* ~~Score boxes are there and keep track of wins~~
* ~~Post button is there but doesn't connect to the database yet.~~
* ~~Can determine wins and tie games~~
* Player 2 (COM) logic needs to be written
  * ~~Study board array input~~
  * ~~if COM has a winning move, take it.~~
  * ~~If opponent has a winning move, block it.~~
  * if this move creates fork after move, it's important. (2 possibilities for winning)
  * block opponent forks
  * count possibilities for winning for each possibility. move with highest score is the next move
  * ~~make move in array.  it keeps track internally.~~
  * ~~get button ID for desired move, and run changeIcon(); and nextPlayer();~~
* Create Database.
* Get Post button to connect to the database.
* Finish Player 2 delay.  (Getting there)
* Oh yeah, and delete unused classes and code.  JEEZ.
* Randomize Guess if there's no win/block to be made.  Makes player2 less predictable.  Or look ahead 2 turns.
* other stuff too but it's 2am and I'm tired.
